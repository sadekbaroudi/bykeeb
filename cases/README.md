### explanation of file names

* `bykeeb-on-off-switch-long` vs `bykeeb-on-off-switch-short` - the long will not fit in the carrying case, but is more convenient to switch on and off. The short one will fit in the carrying case
* `bykeeb-body-left-inset-0.2mm` - The `inset-0.2mm` models go in 0.2mm in the inside perimeter of the body. It's a bit of a tighter fit for the pcb. This is in case the pcb doesn't snap fit into the body well enough for the non-inset version.

## assembly

The pcb is a press fit into the body.

For the cover, you should melt the heat set inserts into the mounting points, and then screw into the heat set inserts from the bottom of the pcb.
