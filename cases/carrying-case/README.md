# bykeeb carrying case

There are effectively two versions of this case. The print-in-place and the hinge-assembly-required versions. The difference between these two is that the print in place requires that you print the whole case in one print. Recognizing that some print beds are not large enough to accommodate this, I also included the hinge-assembly-required version. In this version, the center hinge for the case is hollowed out to allow you to independently print the left and right halves.

| 1        | Rod with diameter: 4.5mm - 5mm and length: ~95mm                    | The rod should have a mechanism to screw in or cap at either end to allow you to use it as a hinge for the two halves. I don't have any recommendations on where to get this, as I haven't built one myself. |

## Magnet assembly

For the magnets on each of these cases, you should put a touch of super glue in the holes for the magnets, and press them in. Be very careful to make sure the magnet's polarity is correct between the two halves!
